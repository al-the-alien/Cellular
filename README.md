# Cellular

A clojure library playing around with cellular automata.
Relies on [clojure-lanterna](http://sjl.bitbucket.org/clojure-lanterna/) for
the visualization.

At the moment, it only implements [Langton's Ant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant).

## Usage

Move into the project's home directory, and execute 'lein run'.
It takes a good 15 seconds to work, so be patient.
Hit the esc key to stop the automaton and close the screen. You must quit
manually from the terminal to stop the process completely.

## FIXME
Figure out why it takes so long to start.
